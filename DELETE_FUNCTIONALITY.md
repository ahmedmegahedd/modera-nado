# Product Delete Functionality

## Overview
A delete button has been added to product cards on the Shop page that allows admin users to delete products directly from the product listing.

## Features

### üî¥ Delete Button
- **Location**: Top-right corner of each product card
- **Visibility**: Only visible to admin users
- **Design**: Red circular button with "√ó" symbol
- **Hover Effects**: Scales up and darkens on hover

### üõ°Ô∏è Security
- **Admin Only**: Delete functionality is restricted to admin users only
- **Authentication**: Requires valid JWT token
- **Confirmation**: Shows confirmation dialog before deletion

### ‚ö° User Experience
- **Confirmation Dialog**: "Are you sure you want to delete [Product Name]?"
- **Instant Update**: Product disappears from the list immediately after successful deletion
- **Error Handling**: Shows error messages if deletion fails
- **Non-intrusive**: Button doesn't interfere with product link functionality

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components
1. **ProductCard.jsx**: 
   - Added delete button with admin-only visibility
   - Uses `useAuth()` hook to check admin status
   - Handles click events and confirmation

2. **Shop.jsx**:
   - Added `handleDelete` function
   - Makes DELETE request to backend API
   - Updates local state after successful deletion
   - Passes `onDelete` prop to ProductCard components

### Backend API
- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/products/:id`
- **Authentication**: Requires admin authentication middleware
- **Response**: Returns success message or error details

### CSS Styling
- **Position**: Absolute positioning in top-right corner
- **Colors**: Red background (#ff4444) with white text
- **Effects**: Hover animations and shadow effects
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes

## Usage

### For Admin Users:
1. Navigate to the Shop page
2. Look for red "√ó" buttons on product cards
3. Click the delete button
4. Confirm deletion in the dialog
5. Product will be removed from the list

### For Regular Users:
- Delete buttons are not visible
- Normal shopping experience is unaffected

## Error Handling
- **Network Errors**: Shows "Error deleting product. Please try again."
- **API Errors**: Displays specific error message from backend
- **Authentication Errors**: Redirects to login if token is invalid

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/ProductCard.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/ProductCard.css`
- `frontend/src/pages/Shop.jsx`
- `backend/api/products.js` (already had DELETE endpoint)

## Testing
To test the delete functionality:
1. Login as an admin user
2. Navigate to Shop page
3. Look for red delete buttons on products
4. Click delete and confirm
5. Verify product is removed from the list
